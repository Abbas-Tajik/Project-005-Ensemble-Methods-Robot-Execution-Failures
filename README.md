  This assignment focused on applying ensemble learning techniques to the Robot Execution Failures dataset.
  I explored methods like bagging and boosting to improve predictive accuracy and compared the results with
  basic classification models. The work involved data cleaning, feature selection, and evaluating the
  performance of each ensemble method. It helped me gain practical experience with combining models to
  achieve more reliable predictions and reinforced my understanding of applied machine learning workflows.
